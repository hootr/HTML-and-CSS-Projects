	<h1>What it means to be a Truck Driver</h1>

<p>Here are two quotes from CDLlife.com</p>

<blockquote cite="https://cdllife.com/2012/what-it-means-to-be-a-truck-driver/">
"It means being dedicated to your country…without trucks, America stops. It means hard work, determination, and for those like me, a passion that lives deep in your veins with a sense of pride and dignity, responsibility and safety".
<p>"To be a truck driver is to be an unsung hero. A lot of people don’t understand the struggles we go through to move the goods necessary to maintain our civilized lives".</p>
</blockquote>
